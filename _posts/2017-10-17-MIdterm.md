title: The Tree Canopy of the Borough of Camden, London 
description: "The NYC Street Trees Map by Jill Hubley<sup>1</sup> fascinated me from the first time I saw it- it was a colorful and creative representation that exhibited the data easily, accurately and beautifully. I wanted to create a map of all the trees in London to compare that representation with the NYC Street Tree Map<sup>1</sup>. I wanted to see what the canopy would look like and the distribution of the trees in different areas. Through this process I encountered many obstacles and overcame some of them. As a result I was able to create a visual representation of all the trees in the London Borough of Camden. "

<b>Data:</b>
Initially I wanted my map to show all the trees in London so that I could compare it to the NYC canopy, and I did find a CSV file on the <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/local-authority-maintained-trees">data.gov.uk</a> website , but there was an error while converting the CSV to a Geojson file.
