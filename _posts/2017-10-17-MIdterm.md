title: The Tree Canopy of the Borough of Camden, London 
description: "The NYC Street Trees Map by Jill Hubley<sup>1</sup> fascinated me from the first time I saw it- it was a colorful and creative representation that exhibited the data easily, accurately and beautifully. I wanted to create a map of all the trees in London to compare that representation with the NYC Street Tree Map<sup>1</sup>. I wanted to see what the canopy would look like and the distribution of the trees in different areas. Through this process I encountered many obstacles and overcame some of them. As a result I was able to create a visual representation of all the trees in the London Borough of Camden. "
