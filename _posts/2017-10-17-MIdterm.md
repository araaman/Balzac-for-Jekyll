title: The Tree Canopy of the Borough of Camden, London 
description: "The NYC Street Trees Map by Jill Hubley1 fascinated me from the first time I saw it- it was a colorful and creative representation that exhibited the data easily, accurately and beautifully. I wanted to create a map of all the trees in London to compare that representation with the NYC Street Tree Map<sup>1</sup>. I wanted to see what the canopy would look like and the distribution of the trees. Through this process I encountered many obstacles and learnt many new things, and as a result I was able to create a map that shows all the trees in the London Borough of Camden. "
